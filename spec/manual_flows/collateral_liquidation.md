# Collateral liquidation

## Implementation

Allow issuers to liquidate themselves with flash loans

### Pros:

- Issuers can use collateral to repay loans early.
  - If the collateral has gone up in value and the issuer wants to use the collateral to repay the loan, they can take out a flash loan, swap it to Uniswap or another protocol, and pay off their bonds.
- No need for oracles.
  - If a default occurs and the collateral cannot be used to pay off the unpaid principal + interest, it must be less valuable than the unpaid principal + interest. Therefore, it is transferred to the bond holders.

### Cons:

- Using a flash loan is complex and will require the DAO to write custom smart contracts
  - We could write smart contracts for the DAO to use to liquidate themselves.
- It may be difficult to line up a large amount of liquidity for collateral sales.
  - However, that means it would have been difficult for bondholders to line up the liquidity as well.

## User flow:

1. For non-convertible bonds, we will allow DAOs to take out a flashloan from the collateral contract to repay the bondâ€™s principal and interest
2. If the principal and interest is not repaid by the maturity date, bondholders will be able to redeem their bonds for the collateral and a defaulted bond token. This token represents the unpaid debt the DAO owes the bondholders.
