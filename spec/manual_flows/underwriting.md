# Underwriting

## Implementation

Sherpas will be handling underwriting. Their responsibilities will include:

- Work with DAOs to design the bond structure
- Assist in determining market timing for issuance
- Assist in developing bond documents (prospectus and financial statements)
- Assist DAO in marketing bonds to accredited investors
- Solicit price views from investors

### Pros

- DAOs have an org to help them through the bond issuance process
- Having a reputable sherpa should lead to lower borrowing costs
- DAOs will be more likely to use Porter due to their existing ties to sherpas
- Partnering with sherpas boosts the brand of Porter from association
- Offloads the responsibility of underwriting which enables Porter to scale
- Offloads some legal risk associated with issuing bonds from Porter
- We create a moat by partnering with entities that do governance work
- We become un-forkable

### Cons

- We are giving up potential revenues by offloading value creation to sherpas

## User flow:

1. DAO reaches out to sherpa by filling out form
2. Sherpa and DAO agree sherpa will advise on bond auction
3. Sherpa fulfills the above responsibilities
4. Sherpa aids DAO in creating their auction and sherpa (who is whitelisted by contract) signs a transaction to add themselves as the auction sherpa
5. The auction shows up in the sherpaâ€™s list of auctions on the auction discovery page
6. DAO pays sherpa after debt is issued
