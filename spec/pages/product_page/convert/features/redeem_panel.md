### Disabled state

I'm not sure how best to handle this.
Objectives:

- Show user there is a "redeem panel" and how it might work
- Show user how many bonds they have in their wallet
- Explain to user when the panel will be active
  - Panel will be active at maturity date or when bond is repaid fully. Whichever comes first.
- Offer to notify the user when they use the panel
