* The DAOs who need access to credit will use Porter to achieve financing because Porter offers under-collateralized financing without the threat of liquidation which allows DAOs to focus on building and makes them feel safe.
* The investors who need to find yield bearing assets will use Porter to achieve a competitive return because Porter offers liquid, high yield bonds that offer equity upside and downside protection which makes investors feel safe.
